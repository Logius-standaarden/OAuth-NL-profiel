## Client Profiles
<!-- ### [2.](#rfc.section.2) [Client Profiles](#ClientProfiles) -->

<!-- ### [2.1.](#rfc.section.2.1) [Client Types](#ClientTypes) -->
### Client Types

The following profile descriptions give patterns of deployment for use in different types of client applications based on the OAuth grant type. Additional grant types, such as assertions, chained tokens, or other mechanisms, are out of scope of this profile and must be covered separately by appropriate profile documents.

<!-- ### [2.1.1.](#rfc.section.2.1.1) [Full Client with User Delegation](#FullClient) -->
#### Full Client with User Delegation

This client type applies to clients that act on behalf of a particular resource owner and require delegation of that user’s authority to access the protected resource. Furthermore, these clients are capable of interacting with a separate web browser application to facilitate the resource owner's interaction with the authentication endpoint of the authorization server.

These clients MUST use the authorization code flow of OAuth 2 by sending the resource owner to the authorization endpoint to obtain authorization. The user MUST authenticate to the authorization endpoint. The user’s web browser is then redirected back to a URI hosted by the client service, from which the client can obtain an authorization code passed as a query parameter. The client then presents that authorization code along with its own credentials (private_key_jwt) to the authorization server's token endpoint to obtain an access token.

These clients MUST be associated with a unique public key, as described in [Section 2.3.4](#client-keys).

This client type MAY request and be issued a refresh token if the security parameters of the access request allow for it.

<!-- ### [2.1.2.](#rfc.section.2.1.2) Native Client with User Delegation -->
#### Native Client with User Delegation

This client type applies to clients that act on behalf of a particular resource owner, such as an app on a mobile platform, and require delegation of that user's authority to access the protected resource. Furthermore, these clients are capable of interacting with a separate web browser application to facilitate the resource owner's interaction with the authentication endpoint of the authorization server. In particular, this client type runs natively on the resource owner's device, often leading to many identical instances of a piece of software operating in different environments and running simultaneously for different end users.

These clients MUST use the authorization code flow of OAuth 2 by sending the resource owner to the authorization endpoint to obtain authorization. The user MUST authenticate to the authorization endpoint. The user is then redirected back to a URI hosted by the client, from which the client can obtain an authorization code passed as a query parameter. The client then presents that authorization code along to the authorization server's token endpoint to obtain an access token.

Native clients MUST either:

*   use dynamic client registration to obtain a separate client id for each instance, or
*   act as a public client by using a common client id and use PKCE [[RFC7636]] to protect calls to the token endpoint.

Native applications using dynamic registration SHOULD generate a unique public and private key pair on the device and register that public key value with the authorization server. Alternatively, an authorization server MAY issue a public and private key pair to the client as part of the registration process. In such cases, the authorization server MUST discard its copy of the private key. Client credentials MUST NOT be shared among instances of client software.

Dynamically registered native applications MAY use PKCE.

Native applications not registering a separate public key for each instance are considered Public Clients, and MUST use PKCE [[RFC7636]] with the S256 code challenge mechanism. Public Clients do not authenticate with the Token Endpoint in any other way.

<!-- ### [2.1.3.](#rfc.section.2.1.3) [Direct Access Client](#DirectClient) -->
#### Direct Access Client



This client type MUST NOT request or be issued a refresh token.

This profile applies to clients that connect directly to protected resources and do not act on behalf of a particular resource owner, such as those clients that facilitate bulk transfers.

These clients use the client credentials flow of OAuth 2 by sending a request to the token endpoint with the client's credentials and obtaining an access token in the response. Since this profile does not involve an authenticated user, this flow is appropriate only for trusted applications, such as those that would traditionally use a developer key. For example, a partner system that performs bulk data transfers between two systems would be considered a direct access client.

<!-- ### [2.2.](#rfc.section.2.2) [Client Registration](#ClientRegistration) -->
### Client Registration

All clients MUST register with the authorization server. For client software that may be installed on multiple client instances, such as native applications or web application software, each client instance MAY receive a unique client identifier from the authorization server. Clients that share client identifiers are considered public clients.

Client registration MAY be completed by either static configuration (out-of-band, through an administrator, etc...) or dynamically.

<!-- ### [2.2.1.](#rfc.section.2.2.1) [Redirect URI](#RedirectURI) -->
#### Redirect URI

Clients using the authorization code grant type MUST register their full redirect URIs. The Authorization Server MUST validate the redirect URI given by the client at the authorization endpoint using strict string comparison.

A client MUST protect the values passed back to its redirect URI by ensuring that the redirect URI is one of the following:

*   Hosted on a website with Transport Layer Security (TLS) protection (a Hypertext Transfer Protocol – Secure (HTTPS) URI)
*   Hosted on a client-specific non-remote-protocol URI scheme (e.g., `myapp://`)
*   Hosted on the local domain of the client (e.g., `http://localhost/`).

Clients MUST NOT allow the redirecting to the local domain.

Clients SHOULD NOT have multiple redirect URIs on different domains.

Clients MUST NOT forward values passed back to their redirect URIs to other arbitrary or user-provided URIs (a practice known as an "open redirector").

<!-- ### [2.3.](#rfc.section.2.3) Connection to the Authorization Server -->
### Connection to the Authorization Server


<!-- ### [2.3.1.](#rfc.section.2.3.1) [Requests to the Authorization Endpoint](#RequestsToAuthorizationEndpoint) -->
#### Requests to the Authorization Endpoint

Full clients and browser-embedded clients making a request to the authorization endpoint MUST use an unpredictable value for the state parameter with at least 128 bits of entropy. Clients MUST validate the value of the <samp>state</samp> parameter upon return to the redirect URI and MUST ensure that the state value is securely tied to the user’s current session (e.g., by relating the state value to a session identifier issued by the client software to the browser).

Clients MUST include their full redirect URI in the authorization request. To prevent open redirection and other injection attacks, the authorization server MUST match the entire redirect URI using a direct string comparison against registered values and MUST reject requests with an invalid or missing redirect URI.

<!-- iGov-NL : Start of the additional content -->
<aside class=" addition">
<b>iGov-NL : Additional content</b></br>  

Public clients MUST apply PKCE, as per RFC7636.
As `code_verifier` the S256 method MUST be applied.
Effectively this means that Browser based and Native Client MUST include a cryptographic random `code_challenge` of at least 128 bits of entropy and the `code_challenge_method` with the value `S256`.

Request fields:

<!-- ### [2.3.3.](#rfc.section.2.3.3) [Requests to the Token Endpoint](#RequestsToTokenEndpoint) -->
#### Requests to the Token Endpoint

Full clients, native clients with dynamically registered keys, and direct access clients as defined above MUST authenticate to the authorization server's token endpoint using a JWT assertion as defined by the [JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants][[rfc7523]] using only the <samp>private_key_jwt</samp> method defined in [OpenID Connect Core] [[OpenID.Core]] . The assertion MUST use the claims as follows:

<dl>

<dt>iss</dt>

<dd style="margin-left: 8">the client ID of the client creating the token</dd>

<dt>sub</dt>

<dd style="margin-left: 8">the client ID of the client creating the token</dd>

<dt>exp</dt>

<dd style="margin-left: 8">the expiration time, after which the token MUST be considered invalid</dd>

<dt>jti</dt>

<dd style="margin-left: 8">a unique identifier generated by the client for this authentication. This identifier MUST contain at least 128 bits of entropy and MUST NOT be re-used by any subsequent authentication token.</dd>

</dl>

<aside class="example">
The following sample claim set illustrates the use of the required claims for a client authentication JWT as defined in this profile; additional claims MAY be included in the claim set.

</pre>
</aside>

The JWT assertion MUST be signed by the client using the client's private key. See [Section 2.3.4](#client-keys) for mechanisms by which the client can make its public key known to the server.
The authorization server MUST support the RS256 signature method (the Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) signature algorithm with a 256-bit hash) and MAY use other asymmetric signature methods listed in the JSON Web Algorithms ( [JWA] [[rfc7518]] ) specification.

<!-- iGov-NL : Start of the additional content -->
<aside class=" addition">
<b>iGov-NL : Additional content</b></br>  

In addition to above signing methods, the Authorization server SHOULD support PS256 signing algorithm [[RFC7518]] for the signing of the private\_key\_jwt.

Effectively, the Token Request has the following content:

<dd>Mandatory. MUST have the value as obtained during registration.</dd>
<dt>client_assertion_type</dt>
<dd>Mandatory. MUST have the value `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`, properly encoded.</dd>

<!-- ### [2.3.4.](#rfc.section.2.3.4) [Client Keys](#ClientKeys) -->
#### Client Keys

Clients using the authorization code grant type ~~or direct access clients using the client credentials grant type~~ MUST have a public and private key pair for use in authentication to the token endpoint. These clients MUST register their public keys in their client registration metadata by either sending the public key directly in the <samp>jwks</samp> field or by registering a <samp>jwks\_uri</samp> that MUST be reachable by the authorization server. It is RECOMMENDED that clients use a <samp>jwks_uri</samp> if possible as this allows for key rotation more easily. This applies to both dynamic and static (out-of-band) client registration.

The <samp>jwks</samp> field or the content available from the <samp>jwks\_uri</samp> of a client MUST contain a public key in [JSON Web Key Set (JWK Set)] [[rfc7517]] format. The authorization server MUST validate the content of the client's registered jwks_uri document and verify that it contains a JWK Set. The following example is of a 2048-bit RSA key:

In case the Authorization Server, Resource Server and client are not operated under responsibility of the same organisation, each party MUST use PKIoverheid certificates with OIN.
The PKIoverheid certificate MUST be included either as a <code>x5c</code> or as <code>x5u</code> parameter, as per [[rfc7517]] §4.6 and 4.7. Parties SHOULD at least support the inclusion of the certificate as <code>x5c</code> parameter, for maximum interoperability. 
Parties MAY agree to use <code>x5u</code>, for instance for communication within specific environments.
