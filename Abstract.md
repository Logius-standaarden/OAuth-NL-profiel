## Abstract
<!-- ### [Abstract](#rfc.abstract) -->
The OAuth 2.0 protocol framework defines a mechanism to allow a resource owner to delegate access to a protected resource for a client application.

This specification profiles the OAuth 2.0 protocol framework to increase baseline security, provide greater interoperability, and structure deployments in a manner specifically applicable, but not limited to consumer-to-government deployments in the Netherlands.

[The Governance of this standard](https://gitdocumentatie.logius.nl/publicatie/api/beheermodel/) is described by the API-Standaarden beheermodel in a [separate repository](https://github.com/Logius-standaarden/API-Standaarden-Beheermodel/) and published by Logius.
