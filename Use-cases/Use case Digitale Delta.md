## Overview

The Digitale Delta API provides access to measurements and related information.
Consumers of the data, in general, will be automated processes or systems such as Business Intelligence or GIS systems.
Since not all data may be open or public, access to certain data must be restricted.

For this scenario, an interactive authentication method is not feasible and not all devices may equiped with PKI Overheid certificates.

Next to requesting data, the API allows for adding or removing data by using import files or sensor devices. 

Client credential flow does offer the required functionality.
