## Overview

The Digitale Delta provides access to measurements and related information.Since the volume of data is large and not all data is open, some data must be protected for specific uses. Most  of the data is accessed by automated processes. For these scenario's an interative authentication method is not feasible. Since not all data-requesters are organisations, PKI Overheid certificates are also not an option.

Client credential flow, however, is.

Next to requesting data, the API allows for adding or removing data by using imports or using sensors. This can also be an automated proces and needs to be protected.
Client credential flow also provides the required protection.
