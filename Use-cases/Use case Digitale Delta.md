## Overview

The Digitale Delta provides access to measurements and related information.
Since the volume of data is large and not all data is open, some data must be protected for specific uses. 

Most of the data is accessed by automated processes. 

For this scenario, an interactive authentication method is not feasible.

Not all devices may equiped to hold PKI Overheid certificates.

Client credential flow does offer the required functionality.

Next to requesting data, the API allows for adding or removing data by using imports or sensor devices. 

This can also be an automated proces and needs to be protected.
Client credential flow also provides the required protection mechanism.
